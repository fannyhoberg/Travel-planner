# VISTA - travel planner

## Project description

Vista is an easy-to-use planning tool, specifically meant to help users plan their trips or vacations. When planning a trip, # people often research restaurants, museums, or other places they want to visit. A notepad is a common tool for gathering such ideas and plans.

However, when you’re on your trip, you might need to locate a place on the map or figure out how to get there, which often involves using multiple apps like Google Maps to look up the addresses. Vista combines these needs into a single app, allowing users to list places to visit, view locations on a map, and get directions. Additionally, the app provides inspiration from other user’s trip documents.

## Features

- Create a document for your trip

- Inside document - create list of category of choice, 'Restaurants', 'Museums', 'Shopping' for example.

- Add an item to list with name and adress (is optional but if added a map with pin will appear)

- Check item as done, if place has been visited and you want to have a good overview of what's visited and not

- Move item to other list. If for example a place you've added to list 'Restaurants' actually belongs in list 'Bars'

- Click on map pin to get info and directions

- Trip document, lists and items are all editable and removable

- Inviting friend to share trip document

Enjoy Vista!
